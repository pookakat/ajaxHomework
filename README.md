This is a very simple website that accesses giphy's API, builds a set of 10 cards with data on the gif shown, the image itself, the ability to pause and play the gif, and an ability to set the gif as a favorite. It also allows for user input and saves favorites in the localStorage for future perusal. Enjoy, and remember, 42 is the magic number.  Access too many times, and it will need a cool-down, thanks to Giphy's rules of engagement.
